Training the SVM
=======================

Overview
----------

The project uses SVM from the scikit-learn (`link <https://github.com/openyou/emokit/>`_) library to perform the classification. 
The SVM behaviour can be altered by modifying the variables in learner.py.
More information about SVM is available in the scikit documentation: 
`here <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html>`_
The number of detected states can be modified by altering the corresponding value in learner.py.
